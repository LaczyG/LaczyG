## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm from Hungary and Iâ€™m passionate about strategy, problem-solving, and backend development. That passion led me to programming â€” especially in C# and Java, my favorite languages.
I love building efficient, scalable systems and constantly exploring new ways to improve my code and architecture. Always up for a challenge and open to collaboration.
